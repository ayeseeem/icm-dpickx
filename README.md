Data Pickaxe for XML
====================

Library for extracting and checking parts of an XML document

Origin
------

This code was extracted from a personal project with a view to one day
publishing it as a separate module. It sat untouched for years, but perhaps
now is the time to do that.

It was originally inspired by some of the XPath matching in
[Spring MVC Test](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/master/spring-test),
but I needed something more general for XML (and JSON), and I wanted
something that would eventually allow me to capture required or optional
values from the node too.
